# About
The Monthly-Maintenace-Mover (MMM) scripts the routine archival of equipment documentation. I wrote the script to solve the issue of my laboratory cowokers having varying levels of comfort with operating computers. The use of this script has reduced the time required to archive by up to 2 hours for some of my colleagues.

# How to Use
Download the MonthlyMaintenanceMover.ps1 and open with Windows PowerShell
